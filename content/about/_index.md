title: "About Dingning Zhang"

I am Dingning Zhang 张丁宁, a predoctoral researcher in the PhD Programme in Cognitive Science and Language (CCiL) at the University of Barcelona, supervised by Dr. Dan Dediu and Dr. Wendy Elvira-García, and currently funded by the PREDOCS-UB-Santander predoctoral research contract (2025–2029) and Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Students Abroad (Class A, 2024).

I work in the Department of Catalan Philology and General Linguistics at the Faculty of Philology and Communication. I am also affiliated with the University of Barcelona Institute of Complex Systems (UBICS) and the Laboratory of Phonetics, and a member of the research group at the Center for Language and Computation(CLiC). I participate in the research project “What Shapes Language? Experimental, Cross-Linguistic, and Computational Approaches to Understanding Linguistic Diversity” (PID2022-138501NB-I00, Principal Investigator: Dr. Dan Dediu).

My research focuses on the phonetics and phonology of rhotic consonants, with a particular interest in the Hubei trill in Southwest Mandarin and its implications for the acquisition of Spanish and Catalan rhotics by L1 Chinese speakers. I combine experimental phonetics, second language acquisition, sociophonetics, and cognitive approaches to understand why complex sounds such as trills emerge, how they change over time, and how learners acquire them across languages.

### Ongoing projects

- **A large-scale experimental investigation of the Hubei trill**, documenting its acoustic and articulatory properties using ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) and quantitative modelling (regression and Bayesian approaches).
- **Cross-linguistic production and perception studies** on the Spanish and Catalan tap–trill contrast among L1 Chinese learners of L2 Spanish and Catalan.
- **A systematic review of Chinese–Spanish rhotic similarity**, framed within the Speech Learning Model (SLM) and the Perceptual Assimilation Model for L2 (PAM-L2).
- **A systematic scope review of the Hubei trill**, examining its phonetic and phonological characteristics, its historical and areal development, and the mechanisms underlying its emergence and persistence.
