## About me

Hi!

I am Zhang, Dingning 张丁宁 [ʈ͡ʂaŋ˥ tiŋ˥ niŋ˧˥], a predoctoral researcher in the PhD Programme in **Cognitive Science and Language (CCiL)** at the **University of Barcelona**, supervised by **Dr. Dan Dediu** and **Dr. Wendy Elvira-García**, and currently funded by the PREDOCS-UB-Santander predoctoral research contract (2025–2029) and the Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Students Abroad (Class A, 2024).

---

## Institutional affiliation

I work in the **Department of Catalan Philology and General Linguistics** at the **Faculty of Philology and Communication**. I am also affiliated with the **University of Barcelona Institute of Complex Systems (UBICS)** and the **Laboratory of Phonetics**, and a member of the research group at the **Center for Language and Computation (CLiC)**.

I participate in the research project *“What Shapes Language? Experimental, Cross-Linguistic, and Computational Approaches to Understanding Linguistic Diversity”* (PID2022-138501NB-I00, Principal Investigator: **Dr. Dan Dediu**).

---

## Research focus

My research focuses on the phonetics and phonology of rhotic consonants, with a particular interest in the **Hubei trill** in Southwest Mandarin and its implications for the acquisition of Spanish and Catalan rhotics by L1 Chinese speakers.

I combine experimental phonetics, second language acquisition, sociophonetics, and cognitive approaches to understand why complex sounds such as trills emerge, how they change over time, and how learners acquire them across languages.

---

## Teaching experiences

In addition to my academic work, I have six years of professional experience as an IELTS Listening and Speaking instructor. I currently teach at **New Oriental (新东方)**, where I have trained more than 1,000 students with over 5,000 hours of accumulated teaching time.

In 2025, I founded **Dingning Education Technology Co., Ltd.**, a company dedicated to IELTS teaching and personalized consulting for overseas study applications.

## Ongoing study

- A large-scale experimental investigation of the Hubei trill, documenting its acoustic and articulatory properties using ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) and quantitative modelling (regression and Bayesian approaches).


- Cross-linguistic production and perception studies on the Spanish and Catalan tap–trill contrast among L1 Chinese learners of L2 Spanish and Catalan.

  
- A systematic review of Chinese–Spanish rhotic similarity, framed within the Speech Learning Model (SLM) and the Perceptual Assimilation Model for L2 (PAM-L2).

  
- A systematic scope review of the Hubei trill, examining its phonetic and phonological characteristics, its historical and areal development, and the mechanisms underlying its emergence and persistence.

## Beyond academia

Beyond research and teaching, I am passionate about literature and music:

*Wo die Sprache aufhört, fängt die Musik an.*
