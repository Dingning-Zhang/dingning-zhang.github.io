## Abstract

The acquisition of Spanish rhotic consonants—including the alveolar tap and trill—poses persistent difficulties for L1 Chinese learners and often requires extended periods of exposure and practice. According to major L2 speech models such as the Speech Learning Model (SLM) and the Perceptual Assimilation Model for Second Language Acquisition (PAM-L2), these challenges can be attributed to cross-linguistic phonetic similarity patterns between Chinese and Spanish rhotics. While SLM primarily addresses production in advanced L2 learners and bilinguals, PAM-L2 focuses on perceptual assimilation patterns among late L2 learners and naïve listeners.

This study provides a comprehensive review of 42 empirical works on rhotics in Chinese and Spanish. It first synthesizes the phonetic characteristics of rhotic sounds in both languages, and then examines three key cross-linguistic correspondences:  
1. Chinese syllable-initial /ɻ/ vs. Spanish tap /ɾ/  
2. Chinese syllable-initial /ɻ/ vs. Spanish trill /r/  
3. Chinese syllable-final /ɚ/ vs. Spanish tap /ɾ/

These correspondences are analyzed across five dimensions: IPA Comparison (IC), Acoustic Difference (AD), Feature Redeployment (FR), Articulatory Similarity (AS), and Phonological Similarity (PS). The results are interpreted within both SLM and PAM-L2 frameworks.

IC and AD analyses indicate low phonetic similarity, classifying the Spanish rhotics as *new sounds* under SLM, predicting gradual improvement through increased L2 exposure. In contrast, FR, AS, and PS analyses categorize the rhotic pairs as equally uncategorized or equally distant under PAM-L2, leading to poor discrimination and persistent acquisition difficulty.

Cross-linguistic transfer effects were observed: negative transfer from Chinese laterals, rhotics, and “er-coda” productions influenced Spanish rhotic realization across syllabic contexts. Interestingly, tap accuracy correlated positively with Spanish proficiency, whereas trill accuracy did not—but once acquired, trills tended to be more stable and more native-like than taps.

Finally, this study identifies a robust acquisition sequence:  
**lateral → tap → trill**,  
and argues that PAM-L2 provides a more predictive and explanatory framework for Spanish rhotic acquisition among L1 Chinese learners than SLM.

Additional factors—including task complexity, phonological environment, dialectal variation in Chinese, Pinyin orthography, and English learning experience—generally exert negative influences on the acquisition of Spanish rhotics.
